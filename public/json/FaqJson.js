    quest: "Why should I hire Suryansh and not a less demanding developer?",
    ans: "The price charged is not only of the efforts or days taken to build clients' website, it also includes the time and struggle I went through to posess the skills I use in building these websites. Less demanding developers usually use shortcuts instead of fresh codes or hire a fresher to build it without paying the the real web builder their due price. Conclusion : Hiring less demanding developers is very risky with lack of sincerity and quality because psychology says 'Money brings Satisfaction and satisfaction is Motivation' Clients never regret hiring me.",
